Interactive Dinner Party Planner
=================================================

An interactive dinner party planner website where you can choose recipes from a large database, customize your dinner, see ingredients, cooking instructions and total costs, and invite friends. You can also see each of your friends' profiles with their preferences, and see their confirmation to your planned dinner.

This website was created in the course Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web at KTH. The master branch contains the website implemented using jQuery. To see the implementation using AngularJS, see branch Lab5beichen.
